Our Team completely developed an autonomous drone for the International Robotics Competition. The challenge consisted of autonomously chasing and catching a second drone, stealing a target and bringing it to a specified position. I entirely designed a mechanical system to link a balloon target to a DJI Phantom with the aim of testing main drone chasing and grasping abilities.
